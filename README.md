# Introduction
This is a diagram template created for building software architectures with Zephyr RTOS's ZBUS service.


![Diagram connection example](https://github.com/Batto1/Zephyr-ZBUS-Architecte-Diagram-Template/assets/76911536/8b9c92c1-c340-403b-a75d-af7959faf649)
## Features

If you have any feedbacks or noticed a mistake, you can open an issue. 


## Example Project
There is an [example architecture](https://github.com/Batto1/Zephyr-ZBUS-Architecte-Diagram-Template/blob/730daa6ae7a3276a20c41233fdf4c2badc79a6ec/Example%20Architecture%20of%20a%20Real%20IoT%20Project.pdf) of a real IoT project provided in this repo. Since this is of an actual work project, most of the information is hidden for confidentiality purposes. But this only conceals the algorithms and characteristics specific to the project, and is still useful for demonstrating how algorithms and flow of the tasks are designed while ZBUS is employed.  
Notice: This is only a snapshot of the project's SW architecture which was ongoing. It may have mistakes or might be incomplete. Developing software from the architecture was still ongoing while this repo was uploaded. If you have any feedbacks or noticed a mistake, please let me know by creating an issue. 

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* go to [draw.io](https://draw.io/) for opening the [ZBUS Architecture Template](https://github.com/Batto1/Zephyr-ZBUS-Architecte-Diagram-Template/blob/730daa6ae7a3276a20c41233fdf4c2badc79a6ec/SW%20Architecture%20With%20ZBUS%20Diagram%20Template%20v1.19.0.drawio). You can also download the [draw.io desktop app](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v22.1.16).
* Familiarity with [ZBUS](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/zbus/index.html).
